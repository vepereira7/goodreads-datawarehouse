# Goodreads - Data warehouse design

This project was carried out as part of the Data Warehouse course and aims to design a data warehouse, implement it, and exemplify its use, applied to Goodreadsâ€™ reality, the chosen dataset. The data can be found [here](https://github.com/zygmuntz/goodbooks-10k).

## Data criteria
- The number of facts must be over 10000 with, at least, one additive measure.
- There must be aggregated facts or snapshots with at least one semi-additive measure.
- There must be at least 4 dimensions, one of which temporal, and some of them are common to both kinds of facts.
